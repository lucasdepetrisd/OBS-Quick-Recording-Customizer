# obs-quick-recording-customizer
Basically I make recordings periodically (due to classes and stuff) and I grew tired of searching and renaming every one of these everyday. I came up with this project for solving this and upgrading OBS's recording button. At the moment this project depends on OBS Websocket so I'll update regularly if it's needed.
